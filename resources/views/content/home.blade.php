                <li>Learn to express yourself! This is a significant asset that will assist you in succeeding in life.</li>
                <li>Don't engage in pointless arguments; it's a waste of time.</li>
                <li>Let your opponent win! If your opponent is happy, thinking they've won, smile silently.</li>
                <li>Remember, sometimes you have to lose in order to win! Your today's loss will bring you a bigger victory.
                </li>
                <li>Learn to lose! You can't win everywhere! Considering this loss as your victory and insisting on winning
                    is foolish.</li>
                <li>Remember, actions speak louder than words! So, start working quietly; your work will speak for you.</li>
                <li>Ignore those who don't believe in you! Believe in yourself! Self-belief will make others believe in you.
                </li>
                <li>You can achieve a lot! Just ask for what you need! Work hard, and what you need will find you.</li>
                <li>Remember, a cheetah never competes in a race with a dog! Let the dogs win! Wait for the right time to
                    show that you are the cheetah.</li>
                <li>When necessary, bypass arguments and work silently! Your work will speak for itself.</li>
                <li>Learn to be humble; if you can be humble, you can conquer the world. This way, step by step, you will
                    overcome every obstacle, and success will knock at your door.</li>
